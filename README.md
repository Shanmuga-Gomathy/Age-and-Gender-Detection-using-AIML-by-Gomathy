# Age-and-Gender-Detection-using-AIML-by-Gomathy
This project demonstrates real-time age and gender prediction from webcam video using OpenCV's deep neural network (cv2.dnn) module and pre-trained Caffe models. It uses face detection to extract regions of interest, and applies age and gender classification to each detected face.
